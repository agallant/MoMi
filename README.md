# MoMi
Monophonic MIDI

MoMi is a simple markup format for representing monophonic MIDI tracks. You can
think of it this way:

That is, MoMi is a human-friendly way to describe a useful subset of MIDI. Why
create such a thing?

1. MIDI is too cumbersome to edit by hand, and firing up serious MIDI editing
   software is overkill if you just want to jot down a simple musical idea
2. For a lot of music, monophonic (single-voice) is "good enough" - melodies are
   typically monophonic, and you can create multiple MoMi tracks to represent
   harmonic work if desired
3. MoMi has a smaller "alphabet" (set of possible symbols) than MIDI, which
   makes it more tractable to data analysis and possibly AI

How does MoMi work? Examples forthcoming...
